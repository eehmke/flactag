Source files and semi stable packages are available at

Installation instructions: these may be incomplete, as I don't have all kind
of systems available. If you find any missing steps, please let me know.

1. Linux

I assume a Debian derived distribution, like Ubuntu or Mint. The package
names and installation methods may vary for other distributions.

python2.7
python3-pyqt4
python-mutagen
python-pycryptopp

2. Mac / OS-X

Use MacPorts to install the needed packages.

port install python27

extract the content of the source code archive into a local directory.

Run the program by

The distributed binary packages are build for a 64bit system. For a 32bit system,
you may have to use the source package.
